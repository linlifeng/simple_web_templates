        <p>I started with a very broad secondary research. I researched how people shop for their groceries. How do they decide what to cook? Do they enjoy it? If any solution More people have swtich to online grocery shopping since the pandemic.</p>
    
        <ul>
            <li>More people have switched to online grocery shopping since the pandemic.</li>
            <li>They would cook whatever they have in the fridge.</li>
            <li>Out of ideas, people would cook the same meal repeatedly.            </li>
            <li>Meal kits are not the perfect ones, due to their high cost, and not-so-desirable meal choices.            </li>

        <h2>Primary Research</h2>
        <p>After the secondary research, I decided to dig deeper into the primary research. I chose the user interview as my research method because when the topic is cooking, nothing comes close to the personal experience a user could provide.</p>

        <h2>Survey</h2>
        <p>Before the interview, I conducted a survey among potential users. It included 8 questions and 15 participants. The questionnaire helped me choose the right interviewees and gain quantitative data.</p>
        <img src="graph"/>


        <h2>User Interview</h2>
        <p>After carefully picking up the interviewees, I conducted 6 interviews and collected a large amount of information. Not only did I learn the entirety of their cooking experiences, but I also grasp their habits and emotions while planning and making meals.</p>

        <div class="section_illustrations">
            <div class="one_third_box">
                <img class="one_third_box_img" />
                <p class="one_third_box_caption">I don't have a car, so I prefer grocery delivery... I like to plan my meals while browsing the groceries.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="one_third_box">
                <img class="one_third_box_img" />
                <p class="one_third_box_caption">I'm cooking as I'm watching a video recipe, and I have to repeat something, but I don't know where to click.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="one_third_box">
                <img class="one_third_box_img" src="third"/>
                <p class="one_third_box_caption">I do find it a bit challenging to find the exact type of spices I'm looking for.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h2>Synthesizing</h2>
        <p>After the interview, all qualitative data were converted into an affinity map, then coded, sorted, regrouped, and prioritized.</p>

        <img src="miro" />

        <h2>Key Findings</h2>
        <p>Even though different users’ cooking and shopping habits are varied, with visualized data, I could still see many overlaps in their thinking patterns and behaviors.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Interviewees would want to use grocery delivery if the cost isn’t too high.</li>
            <li>Most of the interviewees do planning in their heads while shopping for groceries.</li>
            <li>Half of the interviewees get cooking ideas from browsing images/videos.</li>
            <li>Interviewees think the meal kit idea is good, but costs too much and didn’t like the taste of it.</li>
            <li>Most of them would use their own recipes or modify the recipes they find somewhere else.</li>

        </ul>
        
        <hr/>


        <h2>Personas</h2>
        <p>After analyzing the information, I decided to divide the end users into two groups, one older user group, which has a bigger family structure, also has a longer cooking experience.  Another group is the younger users group who just started life on his/her own, and doesn't have much cooking experience, but are forced to cook more to save money. </p>

        <h2>User Flows</h2>
        <p>The ideation stage is when I broadly brainstorm for solution ideas. I decided to create my app based on 2 red routes: 1. the buying groceries route and 2. the looking for recipes/ideas route. I also added an ingredients scanning function to help users manage their ingredients.</p>

        <p>I sketched out my solutions with a digital pencil and conducted remote guerrilla usability tests to quickly test my ideas and gain users’ feedback.</p>
        <img src="sketches.jpg" />

        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p>After testing the first round of low-fidelity mockups, I changed some of the designs and moved into building the medium fidelity wireframes.</p>
        <img src="wireframes.jpg" />

        <h2>Style Guide</h2>
        <p>When it comes to visual design, I wanted to give Foodiee a warm, inspiring. The color and UI elements would match the personality. More importantly, it should be accessible and to better adheres to WCAG standards.</p>

        <h2>Test Plan</h2>
        <p>After the prototype is done, I conduct <strong>5 moderated usability tests</strong>. The goal of this test is to uncover usability problems in the red route and discover user habits for further improvement.</p>
        <ul>
            <p><strong>Test Subjectives</strong></p>
            <li>Can the login process onboarding pages help users figure out some important functions of this app?</li>
            <li>Can users find items and complete the checkout process?</li>            
            <li>How do participants respond to the scanning and pantry functions?</li>
            <li>Can users walk through the scanning process without any confusion?</li>
            <li>Can users find matching recipes without any confusion?</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Test Results and Iterations</h2>
        <p>The test results are interesting and very helpful. I was able to find some major issues after 5 tests.<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kJR_pVLzz7p4KIMzHhFwxbjte-4TKAgnauphHCfb9fo/edit?usp=sharing">FULL REPORT</a></p>

        <ul>
            <p><strong>Key Findings</strong></p>
            <li>Login takes too long and needs a better flow to take users to the Home Page. </li>
            <li>Detail matters: users brought up many wording issues.</li>            
            <li>Complicated functions would scare the users.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Some of the iteration screens</h3>
        <img src="iterations.jpg" />

        <p>After I fixed all the critical issues I ran 5 more tests. The user flows after iteration were significantly improved. Users could go through all tasks much more smoothly.</p>

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>What did I learn?</p>
    </div>
</div>


<div class="section_content">
    <div class="container">
        <p>During this project, I encountered many problems, these problems taught me to always remember that I'm designing for the users, not myself. Look at things from more than one perspective, and try to design the minimum viable product instead of a perfect product.</p>
        <ul>
            <p><strong>Takeaways</strong></p>
            <li>At first, I was going to design a grocery pick-up service. But during research, I realized I didn’t consider those who can't drive or don’t have cars. Design should be more inclusive.</li>
            <li>When doing the user survey, I didn't think demographic would impact this project, but it does! People with different cultures and family structures have very different shopping and cooking habits.</li>            
            <li>Foodiee's design is a “BIG bite” I kept adding more features and trying to make it "does it all" and "perfect" but didn't realize making it right is more important.</li>
            <li>Testing script is important, but the testing flow is important as well. Sometimes, the right design might seem off when testing it in the wrong order. Figuring out whether the issue is in the design or the test is something I would need to improve in my future projects.</li>
